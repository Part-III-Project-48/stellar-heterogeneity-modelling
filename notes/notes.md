next steps:

we want to construct
$F_{\text{tot}} = (1-W) F_{\text{main T}} + \sum w_i F_{\text{component, i}} $

we want the weights to be meaningful. Physically, they are contributing some number of photons? idk if I need to rescale; sum and rescale back down, or just sum them in a scaled way now. I don't thinkit actually matters lmao.
