okay so we need a model that trains on

combined spectra (pseudo-random) + weights of each component

and when given any graph gives the closest representation of that graph as a sum of the components, aka gives us the weights
and from those weights we can tell the fractional area of each temperature

TODO
normalisation
basic ML of some sort
make a spectrum class that has all the things we need like normalisation etc

add proof that the temperature interpolation is working to documentation.md

add the full hdf5 file to a google drive (run on main pc to create)

maybe convert fits_to_hdf5 to use astropy quantities... might be nice

## notes: may as well remove out of range/bounds wavelengths before appending to df, even if we're not regularising the grid
        
stream data to hdf5? to make it a little less bad?

can update wavelength regularisation to include gaussian convolution?
