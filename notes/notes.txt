okay so we need a model that trains on

combined spectra (pseudo-random) + weights of each component

and when given any graph gives the closest representation of that graph as a sum of the components, aka gives us the weights
and from those weights we can tell the fractional area of each temperature

TODO
normalisation
basic ML of some sort

add proof that the temperature interpolation is working to documentation.md
